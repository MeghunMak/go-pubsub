#go-pubsub

A simple abstraction for message publishing and consumption that presents a uniform API, regardless of the underlying implementation.

Current implementations are

- Mock (in memory testing implementation)
- Apache Kafka
- Nats
- Nats (streaming)


THIS IS A WORK IN PROGRESS.  IT IS NOT TESTED AND THE API IS NOT STABLE.
